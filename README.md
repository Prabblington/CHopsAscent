# CHopsAscent
Welcome to CHops! My first game I ever built in Y1 of Computer science. Could use some huge refractoring and I will do that at a later date, slightly buggy but for a first program, it's not too shabby.

It will be refractored and updated at some point as a new commit, please be patient for an update :D

1. To open the file first open the C_hops_Ascent file
2. If told you require a folder named "C_hops_Ascent file", please move all to that folder then open as 
instructed at point 1 
3. Have fun messing around with it :)
